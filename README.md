OBJECTIVE :
Creating a to-do list web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is an excellent project for enhancing the web development skills. Below are the objectives for building this web application:


KEY-ACTIVITIES:
1.User Interface Design (UI)

HTML Structure: Design a clean and intuitive layout using HTML. Include elements such as a header, an input field for new tasks, a button to add tasks, and a list to display tasks.
CSS Styling: Apply CSS to style the application. Ensure it is visually appealing, with a focus on readability and usability. Include responsive design principles to ensure functionality across different devices.

2.Functionality Implementation

Task Deletion: Allow users to remove tasks from the list.
Task Completion: Enable users to mark tasks as completed. This could involve striking through the task or changing its appearance to indicate completion.
Task Editing: Provide an option to edit existing tasks.
Persistence: Use local storage to save tasks so that they persist even after the page is refreshed.

3.Interactivity and User Experience (UX)

Form Validation: Ensure that the input field for adding new tasks is not empty before a task is added.
Feedback: Provide visual feedback for user actions, such as animations or color changes when tasks are added, completed, or deleted.
Accessibility: Make sure the app is accessible to users with disabilities. Use semantic HTML elements and ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes.
